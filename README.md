# Main Website


The goal of this project is to redesign the main Linux Mint website.

## Scope

- We only care about the landing page for now.
- We only work with static content (HTML/CSS, no server backend).

## Themes


In this project we modify a theme called Wizixo.

Pros:

- Great block separators, easy to use
- Gradients and geometrical shapes
- Perfect color palette

Cons:

- Fonts (small, pale, roboto..)

## Structure

- `wizixo/documentation` contains the theme documentation.
- `wizixo/template` contains the root of the mint website. This is where we work.
- `wizixo/*` contains the gulp file to regenerate the assets.
